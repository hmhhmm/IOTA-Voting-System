/// ðŸ§ª IOTA Voting Platform - Widget Tests
/// 
/// This file contains comprehensive widget tests for the IOTA Voting Platform.
/// It tests the core functionality, UI components, and app stability to ensure
/// the application works correctly across different scenarios.
/// 
/// Test Coverage:
/// - App loading and initialization
/// - Widget tree structure validation
/// - UI component presence verification
/// - App stability during rendering
/// - Basic functionality testing
/// 
/// Testing Strategy:
/// - Widget testing using Flutter's test framework
/// - Mock-free testing for real component behavior
/// - Stability testing with multiple render cycles
/// - Component presence validation
